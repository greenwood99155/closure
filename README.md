# Closure Table

> this library provides two adapters: an in-memory one, and one for using the closure-table solution with Ecto; for your testing and development convenience.

The Closure Table solution is a simple and elegant way of storing hierarchies. It involves storing all paths through a tree, not just those with a direct parent-child relationship. You may want to chose this model, over the [Nested Sets model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model), should you need referential integrity and to assign nodes to multiple trees.

Throughout the various examples and tests, we will refer to the hierarchies depicted below, where we're modeling a hypothetical forum-like discussion between [Rolie, Olie and Polie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTkmaE_QWMQ), and their debate around the usefulness of this implementation :)

## Quick start

To start, you can simply use one `Adapter` from the ones provided, same way you'd use the Ecto's own Repo:

```elixir
defmodule CTM do
    use CTE,
      otp_app: :ct_empty,
      adapter: CTE.Adapter.Memory,
      nodes: %{
        1 => %{id: 1, author: "Olie", comment: "Is Closure Table better than the Nested Sets?"},
        2 => %{id: 2, author: "Rolie", comment: "It depends. Do you need referential integrity?"},
        3 => %{id: 3, author: "Polie", comment: "Yeah."}
      },
      paths: [[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 2], [2, 3], [3, 3]]
  end
```

With the configuration above, the `:nodes` attribute is a map containing the comments our interlocutors made; these are "nodes", in CTE's parlance. When using the `CTE.Adapter.Ecto` implementation, the `:nodes` attribute will be a Schema (or a table name! In our initial implementation, the nodes definitions must have at least the `:id`, as one of their properties. This caveat will be lifted in a later implementation. The `:paths` attribute represents the parent-child relationship between the comments.

Add the `CTM` module to your main supervision tree:

```elixir
defmodule CTM.Application do
  @moduledoc false

  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: CTM.Supervisor]

    Supervisor.start_link([CTM], opts)
  end
end
```

And then using `iex -S mix`, for quickly experimenting with the CTE API, let's find the descendants of comment #1:

```elixir
iexÂ» CTM.descendants(1)
{:ok, [3, 2]}
```

Please check the docs for more details and return from more updates!

Oh and there is a simple utility for helping you drawing your paths, using graphviz! From Rolie's comments, excerpt:

Maybe useful?! If yes, then we'll let you find this function by yourself ;)

hint: _check the tests <3_

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/closure_table), the package can be installed
by adding `closure_table` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:closure_table, "~> 0.3"}
  ]
end
```
